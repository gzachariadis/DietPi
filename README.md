## DietPi

DietPi is not an own Operating System or Distribution. **DietPi is a bundle of scripts on top of a standard Debian installation.** Depending on your Single Board computer (SBC), DietPi is using different base images. Mainly used images are Armbian, Meveric or for PRi boards Raspberry OS, that means that Raspberry OS is used as base image, including kernel or firmware, anyway.

## Why DietPi instead of Raspian?

Yes DietPi is an extrem lightweight and slim/diet version of Raspberry OS

Due to the reduced amount of installed software, DietPi is starting much faster. Furthermore the mount of r/w operation has been reduced down to a minimum to allow a longer lifetime of SD cards.
